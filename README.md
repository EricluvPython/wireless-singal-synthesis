# Synthetic Cellular Fingerprinting with Diffusion Transformer and Path-Loss Priors

This research project aims to enhance generative models (e.g., DiT) with physics guidance to increase its data fidelity in synthesizing wireless signals.

This is Eric Gao's Senior Honors Thesis, avised by Professor Khaled Harras.
