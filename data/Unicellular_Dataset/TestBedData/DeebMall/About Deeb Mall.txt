Deeb Mall
At one of the most vital locations in Alexandria, Egypt stands “Deeb Mall”. Deeb mall is an 11- storey shopping mall constructed over an area of 1000 square metres. It includes wide variety of shops, cinemas, an eductaional centre and wedding halls as well. Moreover, the mall’s vertical circulation is really different as the elevator is designed to be a panoramic one that overviews the whole location.
UGCE was awarded the contract by Modern Projects Co as we were in charge of the mall’s structural Design.
